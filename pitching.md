# Heading

## Where does taxpayer money go?

* helping the disadvantaged
* protecting the environment
* improving the economy in a sustainable way
* everyone is being scammed of our money, which could have gone to improving our society

## Vision 

<!-- We envision a world where everyone in the agricultural sector can be held accountable so taxpayers can be sure their money is well spent. We provide an autonomous solution which detects agricultural fraud with minimal human intervention and reports it to the EU directly, without going through middlemen agencies and corrupt governments. -->
We envision a world without fraud in the agricultural sector and our taxpayer money is well spent. We want to make sure that corrupt governments and agencies cannot drain our money and give it to criminals.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide easily accesible data on every field which has recieved subsidies, and make it easily accessible to the public, so anyone can see where fraud is happening. We do this by using satellite imagery, and we have the capability to report directly to the EU, without passing through potentially corrupt agencies.

## What we do 

* Target a field and schedule taking an image
* Remove areas with clouds, and determine whether the image is usable
* Compute positions of identifying features on the image
* Filter only pixels which are in the field
* Using the RGB values, determine whether something is planted on the field or not
* Beam down the status of the field
