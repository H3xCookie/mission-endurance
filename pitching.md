# Heading

## Where does taxpayer money go?

* helping the disadvantaged
* protecting the environment
* improving the economy in a sustainable way
* everyone is being scammed of our money, which could have gone to improving our society

## Vision 

We envision a world where everyone in the agricultural sector can be held accountable so taxpayers can be sure their money is well spent. We provide an autonomous solution which detects agricultural fraud with minimal human intervention and reports it to the EU directly, without going through middlemen agencies and corrupt governments.
* public, easily accessible data
* we can catch up to 100% of fraud in the agricultural sector.
We can make the EU more financially efficient and enable it to monitor agricultural land in an automated and optimised way. We can do this by using satellite imagery.

## Technology
TODO improve
* many different channels of publicly available data, but it is hard to obtain and analyse by humans alone
Automation:
* imaging every part of Europe every 5 days or less
* analysing the images
* reporting the data directly to the EU and the public
By bypassing potentially corrupt agencies and governments we make sure that if fraud is detected, it will be accounted for.

We utilise Sentinel-2 images, which are accessible free of charge.

### First mode of analysis: Index filtering

* taking all bands and combining them in a clever way to indicate how much of vegetation there is on any given field.
We can catch up to 90% of of unplanted fields this way. 

### Second mode: ML models based on past observations of fraud

In partnership with the EU, we can train an ML model to identify patterns which could not be caught with indeces alone. Once we get training data of past events of fraud, our solution will get exponentially more accurate with time, and we can catch up to 100% of agricultural fraud.
